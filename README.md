# hypebot
serverless backend for odphi hypebot

This project was rebuilt to use (Serverless)[https://serverless.com/] as a backend so we can have multiple applications interactin with hypebot.

As of right now, hypebot interacts with users in groupme groups and it's database can be altered from the task management react app.

To see how hypebot was originally built using a standalone server deployed to Heroku, visit the repo.
